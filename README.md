# Mini LEGO Sumo Robot
This repository features a collection of mini LEGO Sumo robot models, developed for educational and competitive robotics applications. Each project includes a 3D CAD model of the robot and its corresponding C/C++ programming code, designed for autonomous behavior using sensors and motors.
These models serve as practical examples for learning robot design, programming logic, and sensor integration in mini sumo challenges.
